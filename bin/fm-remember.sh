#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-remember.sh - best-effort push of ONE captain decision or learning into this
# home's fleet memory (memval-04). A side-effect only: it never blocks, never
# changes the caller's exit status, and never emits diagnostic noise.
#
# It exists so firstmate's natural capture points - a durably recorded captain
# decision (bin/fm-captain-hold.sh) and a /stow knowledge sweep (the stow skill)
# - accumulate the home's memory automatically instead of only when someone runs
# the write CLI by hand.
#
# The write path itself is memval-03's per-home CLI,
# "$FM_HOME/config/memory/memhub-remember.mjs", which is idempotent and
# user_id-scoped, so a repeated decision is a safe no-op. This wrapper only owns
# the fail-open guards around it:
#   - memory not wired for this home (the CLI is absent) -> do nothing, exit 0.
#   - node missing -> do nothing, exit 0.
#   - a slow or down hub -> bounded by FM_REMEMBER_TIMEOUT (fm-timeout-lib.sh) so
#     it can never delay decision-hold, stow, or any firstmate flow. The write CLI
#     is itself internally timeboxed, so this bound is only a hard backstop for a
#     wedged node process; the default is deliberately short.
# Any write failure is swallowed; this command always exits 0.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-remember.sh "<decision or learning text>"
#   printf '%s' "<text>" | fm-remember.sh
