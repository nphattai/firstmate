#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-epic-status.sh - SHOW an epic's dispatch readiness at a glance, so the
# operator never hand-derives it after handoff (report G-dispatch/G-route: the
# pipeline STOPs at the sign gate and the operator had to work out by hand -
# signed? epic branch cut per repo? which stories dispatchable vs blocked? which
# home dispatches?). Its sibling bin/fm-epic-dispatch-plan.sh emits the commands.
#
# Read-only: it mutates nothing and dispatches nothing. It reads the epic dir
# under data/plans/, the backlog Done state, and (per involved repo) whether
# epic/<slug> is cut - via the same primitives the rest of the pipeline owns
# (bin/fm-epic-status-lib.sh reuses bin/fm-epic-branch.sh verify and the
# secondmate registry). Run WITH FM_HOME set to the home that owns the epic.
#
# For a given <slug> it prints:
#   - signed?           epic.md status + signed_off date
#   - epic branches     epic/<slug> present / MISSING per involved repo (N/M cut)
#   - stories           each story's state: DONE | dispatchable | blocked (by ...)
#                       | unseeded, with repo, base, and declared deps
#   - off-plan tasks    backlog tasks that belong to the epic by membership (an
#                       [<slug>] tag or a parent:<slug> edge) but have no story
#                       file - mid-epic follow-ups, decision-holds, splits
#   - dispatch owner    this home, or a candidate secondmate to confirm by scope

Prints, for the epic whose epic.md carries `epic: <slug>` under data/plans/:
signed status, epic/<slug> present/MISSING per involved repo, each story's
dispatchable/blocked/done/unseeded state with its deps, and the dispatch-owning
home. Mutates nothing and dispatches nothing. Run WITH FM_HOME set to the epic's
home. Its sibling bin/fm-epic-dispatch-plan.sh emits the ordered dispatch commands.
