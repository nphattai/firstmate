# fm-umbrella-promote.sh - promote a DESIGNED umbrella epic into this home: move
# the epic dir into data/plans/ and seed its stories into the backlog, then STOP
# at the sign-off gate. Run WITH FM_HOME set to the home that owns the umbrella.
#
# The umbrella lab (bin/fm-umbrella.sh) is where a cross-repo feature is designed;
# its durable output can include a delegable epic under
# umbrellas/<id>/plans/<epic-dir>/ (epic.md + stories/*.md, the harness-agnostic
# standard from the gflow epic). Turning that designed epic into queued backlog
# work used to be a manual, error-prone hand-off: move the dir into the home,
# seed N stories by hand, then sign/branch/dispatch. Two home firstmates botched
# the seed - one hand-seed used ids `lh-01`/tag `[lh]` while the story files were
# `LH-01`/epic `aimica-learning-hub`, so the lint gate flagged 10 ORPHAN tasks and
# the dashboard showed TWO epics (the signed design epic + a mismatched backlog
# epic). This script makes the mechanical promote reliable:
#
#   1. LOCATE the designed epic under umbrellas/<id>/plans/<epic-dir>/.
#   2. VALIDATE before writing anything by running bin/fm-epic-lint.sh (the single
#      owner of the epic/story contract) on the epic dir, so promote and the
#      epic-review gate enforce ONE identical contract; a failure writes nothing.
#      Then enforce two FRESHNESS guards (incident R1/R6): the design must be
#      FROZEN (epic.md status: active) and the sign-off must be CURRENT (signed_off
#      no older than the newest of epic.md, every story, and DESIGN.md, compared at
#      day resolution). A draft status or a stale sign-off is refused, naming the
#      offending file, so a backlog is never seeded from a design that is still
#      moving; --allow-stale-sign downgrades the stale-sign refusal to a loud
#      warning. Both guards write nothing on refusal.
#   3. MOVE the epic dir -> data/plans/<epic-dir>/ (the canonical, durable copy
#      the dashboard/dispatch read) and leave a BACK-SYMLINK in the umbrella at
#      umbrellas/<id>/plans/<epic-dir> pointing to it, so the captain keeps
#      designing the epic in the lab (next to repos/) with edits writing through
#      to the real files - one source of truth, no duplicate, no "materialize on
#      done" step. Idempotent and never-clobber: an existing identical target is
#      reconciled, a DIFFERING target refuses rather than clobbering, and the
#      back-symlink is replaced/verified rather than erroring on a re-run.
#   4. SEED each story into the backlog deriving id/title-tag/repo FROM the story
#      frontmatter, so backlog ids + `[<epic>]` tags always match the story files
#      by construction (no orphans, one epic). CONVERGE the backlog to the
#      canonical epic on every re-run: a missing story is added, and an
#      already-present story whose title/repo/kind DRIFTED from its current
#      frontmatter is rewritten in place (state, blocked-by, holds, and notes
#      preserved). A story FILE renamed to a case/kebab variant of its backlog id
#      (the aimica `LH-01` -> `lh-01` failure) has its backlog id rewritten rather
#      than left orphaned. Only genuinely unresolvable drift - a task carrying
#      this epic's tag that matches no story, or a real double-seed - is REFUSED.
#   5. STOP at the sign-off gate and print the remaining human/firstmate steps
#      (review + sign epic.md, cut epic branches, dispatch, teardown). This script
#      NEVER signs, cuts a branch, or dispatches - those are judgment/approval
#      steps that stay human/firstmate-owned.
#
# The `verify <umbrella-id>` subcommand asserts the promoted end-state without
# mutating anything: the epic is canonical at data/plans, the umbrella
# back-symlink resolves to it, the .promoted marker is present and correct, every
# story file has a matching backlog entry whose brief resolves, and no orphan or
# case-drifted tag remains. It exits non-zero and prints every concrete failure,
# so it is the loud end-state check the aimica incident lacked (and the primitive
# fm-epic-status/dispatch-plan reuse).
#
# Every mutation is fail-closed: all validation AND the full reconcile plan are
# computed first, so a validation or unresolvable-drift failure writes nothing,
# and the move + seed + reconcile are idempotent so a re-run after a partial
# failure safely converges. Same header/--help/override-seam style as
# bin/fm-epic-branch.sh and bin/fm-epic-ship.sh.

Run WITH FM_HOME set to the home that owns the umbrella. `promote` (the default)
moves the designed epic under umbrellas/<id>/plans/<epic-dir>/ into data/plans/,
seeds its stories into the backlog (ids + [<epic>] tags derived from the story
frontmatter, so they match by construction), then STOPS at the branch/dispatch
gate. The contract is sign-THEN-promote: promote REFUSES an epic that is not
frozen (epic.md status must be `active`) or whose signed_off is older than the
newest of epic.md, any story, or DESIGN.md, naming the offending file; re-sign
the current design (or pass --allow-stale-sign to downgrade the stale-sign
refusal to a warning) and re-run. Idempotent and fail-closed: validation, the
freshness guards, and the full reconcile plan all run before any write, a re-run
CONVERGES the backlog to the canonical epic (adds missing stories, rewrites
drifted title/repo/kind, rewrites a case/kebab-renamed id), and only unresolvable
drift is refused. Never signs, branches, or dispatches.

`verify` mutates nothing and exits non-zero (naming every failure) unless the
epic is canonical at data/plans, the umbrella back-symlink resolves to it, the
.promoted marker is correct, every story has a matching backlog brief, and no
orphan/case-drifted tag remains.
