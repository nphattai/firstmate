# umbrella-lab

Use this procedure before standing up, tearing down, or reasoning about a cross-repo umbrella design lab.
An umbrella is a captain-driven workspace, not an autonomous task: it launches no worker, arms no merge poll, and creates no branch.
`docs/cross-repo-workspaces.md` is the single owner of the rationale and the full flow.
`bin/fm-umbrella.sh --help` is the single owner of the exact commands, flags, and layout.
This skill owns only the decision of when to reach for the lab and the discipline around it.

## When an umbrella is the right construct

Reach for an umbrella only when the ambiguous phase of the work is a design that spans several repos at once.
The test is ambiguity, not repository count: the captain needs every repo visible while deciding the cross-repo contract - the shapes, the shared types, the API - and a per-brief delegation would lose that fidelity.

Do not stand up an umbrella when:

- The work fits one repo, even if it is large or hard.
  That is an ordinary ship task.
- The cross-repo contract is already concrete.
  Skip straight to ordinary per-repo tasks anchored to that contract.
- The captain only needs an investigation or a written design, with no side-by-side checkout.
  That is a scout.

When intake looks like a cross-repo feature and the design is still ambiguous, name the umbrella option to the captain in plain language before creating one.

## Prerequisite

Every `--repos` name must resolve to a git clone at `projects/<name>`.
If a named repo is not cloned, load `project-management` and register it first; an umbrella checks out existing clones, it does not fetch new ones.

## Contract-first discipline

The umbrella's only durable output is `umbrellas/<umbrella-id>/DESIGN.md`; the `repos/` worktrees are scratch, exactly like a scout worktree.
The design is finished when it produces a concrete contract that can land first on its own - an OpenAPI spec, a proto file, a shared types package, a schema migration.
Ship that contract as its own ordinary task and let it merge before any dependent per-repo work is delegated.
Never delegate a per-repo task whose contract is still prose; if it has not landed as code, the work belongs back in the lab.
Teardown keeps `DESIGN.md` and discards the scratch worktrees, and follows the same unresolved-decision completion gate scouts use (`decision-hold-lifecycle`).

## Not yet built

Only the lab itself (`create`/`teardown`/`list`) is implemented.
The delegated `--epic` fan-out and aggregate status described in `docs/cross-repo-workspaces.md` section 9 are designed but not built, so the per-repo implementation hand-off is still ordinary tasks dispatched by hand.
